In this SpringBoot project, OpenAI has been integrated to develop a ChatGPT-like application. 
We created interfaces for both Request and Response classes to support various OpenAI request and response objects in the future. 
Similarly, we designed a configuration class to allow for extensions accommodating different OpenAI implementations.


Please use your service key / openAI api key and update it in the application.properties and the application will be ready to launch.
